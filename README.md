# Luxwarp Wallpaper Ubuntu

## Intro

This is my custom-made wallpaper in Luxwarp style. There is a wallpaper both for the desktop and lock screen.

Specially made for Ubuntu and works perfectly with the [Arc theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme).

Made with [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/).
